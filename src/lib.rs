#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]
//! A thin abstraction over OS process scheduling APIs.
//!
//! By signalling the priority of our processes to the operating system, we
//! gain more control over our program's resource usage, and which tasks get
//! completed first.
//!
//! For example, we can configure our UI to preempt background tasks by giving
//! it a higher priority:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use scrummage::{Process, Priority};
//! # // TODO: Find a better cross-platform shell program
//! # let mut busy_child_process = std::process::Command::new("cargo").arg("version").spawn().unwrap();
//! let me = Process::current().priority().unwrap();
//! let boring_work = me.lower().next().expect("no lower priority available");
//! // It's fine if the `busy_child_process` has already finished
//! let _ = Process::from(&mut busy_child_process)
//!     .set_priority(boring_work);
//! ```
//!
//! This will tell the OS to make sure `me` is always given all the resources
//! it needs, making it snappier.
